<p><img src="/1.jpg" alt="BPD" /></p>

<p>When you think of mood disorders, depression and bipolar disorder likely come to mind first. However, Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is also a common personality disorder in psychiatry, which is mainly characterized by emotional, interpersonal relationships, self-image, and behavioral instability, and is accompanied by a variety of impulsive behaviors. It is a complex and serious mental disorder.  People with a borderline personality disorder may experience intense episodes of anger, depression, and anxiety that can last from a few hours to days. The typical characteristics of borderline personality disorder have been described by scholars as “stable instability”, which often manifests as non-compliance in treatment, which is very difficult to treat.</p>

Because people with borderline personality disorder are not sure about relationships, they do not have a stable relationship model and cognition.</p>
