## Borderline Personality disorder——"Who am I?" 
Welcome to my website!

When you think of mood disorders, depression and bipolar disorder likely come to mind first. However, Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is also a common personality disorder in psychiatry, which is mainly characterized by emotional, interpersonal relationships, self-image, and behavioral instability, and is accompanied by a variety of impulsive behaviors. It is a complex and serious mental disorder.  People with a borderline personality disorder may experience intense episodes of anger, depression, and anxiety that can last from a few hours to days. The typical characteristics of borderline personality disorder have been described by scholars as "stable instability", which often manifests as non-compliance in treatment, which is very difficult to treat.
